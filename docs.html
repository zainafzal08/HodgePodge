    <h2> Core Functionality </h2>
    <p>
      Hodge Podge has a couple of features that are build into the core bot,
      other then these, there are many other features that have been attached in modules.
      Note that core functionality is at the bottom of the call chain and will be activated
      only if no other module has already been activated by the message.
    </p>
    <h3> Triggering </h3>
    <p>
        You can trigger hodge podge commands anywhere in a sentence by writing <code>!hp</code>.
        For example <code> !hp roll a d5 </code> You can also do <code> Hodge Podge </code> or <code> Hodgepodge </code> case insensitive.
        You can also mention hodge podge <code> @HodgePodge roll a d5 </code>
        <cmds>
          <c> <hl>Hodge Podge</hl> help</c>
          <c> <hl>HodgePodge</hl> help</c>
          <c> <hl>hodgepodge</hl> help</c>
          <c> <hl>!hp</hl> help</c>
          <c> <hl>@HodgePodge</hl> help</c>
        </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Help </h3>
    <p>
      You can ask hodgepodge for some help, he'll just link you back to this page. You can trigger hodgepodge to send you the link via
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge help</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge docs</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge show documentation</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge how do i...</c>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Enviornment Variables </h3>
    <p>
      Many modules will use some variables to set things like standard responses
      or allowed ranges. See the dice module for a example. These variables are server wide and can be updated by doing
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge set X to Y</c>
        <r> Got it! </r>
      </cmds>
      X must be a variable name and as such is 1 word and snake cake i.e
       <code>critical_hit_msg</code>. The first letter of the varibale must
       not be a underscore, the allowed characters for a variable is any
       character a-z and A-Z + the underscore.
    </p>
    <p> You can reveal a server variable via the <code> reveal </code> command </p>
    <cmds>
      <c> Hodge Podge reveal X</c>
      <r> X = Y </r>
    </cmds>
    <h3> Personality </h3>
    <p>
      Hodge Podge will respond to some things such as <code> Hodge Podge i love you </code>.
    </p>
    <h2> Dice Module </h2>
    <h3> Basic Use </h3>
    <p>
      You can simply say <code> Hodge Podge Roll a dx </code> where x is any
      number 2 to 10000. To roll multiple dice specify a number of dice to roll
      i.e <code> Hodge Podge roll 5 d10 </code>. Because hodge podge just looks for
      the phrase "roll" followed by some numbers you can make your requests more
      dramatic.
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll a d10</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 5 d6</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge my dude roll me a fat d8</c>
        <c> Hodge Podge please roll 7 of those hot hot d18</c>
      </cmds>
      Please note that Hodge podge will display the individual dice rolls if you
       roll up to 20 dice. Any more and Hodge podge just reports the total.
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 3 d2</c>
        <r> I got 4! The breakdown was (1,2,1)</r>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 25 d2</c>
        <r> I got 28 total!</r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Modifiers </h3>
    <p>
      You can also apply modifiers by specifying a plus or minus after your roll.
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll a d10 +3</c>
        <r> I got 8! 5[+3] </r>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll a d10 -3</c>
        <r> I got 2! 5[-3] </r>
      </cmds>
      If you want to apply a modifier to a multi dice roll you have to specify
      if you want the modifier to apply to the total...
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 2 d10 <hl>+3</hl></c>
        <r> I got 13! The breakdown was (5,5)[+3] </r>
      </cmds>
      Or if you want it to apply to every dice roll
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 2 d10 <hl>++3</hl></c>
        <r> I got 16! The breakdown was (5[+3],5[+3]) </r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Rerolling </h3>
    <p>
      Hodge podge will remember the last roll in every channel and will reroll it when asked.
      you simply need to say <code> Hodge podge reroll </code>, hodge podge will ignore all text after the reroll word
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll 2 d10 ++3</c>
        <r> I got 16! The breakdown was (5[+3],5[+3]) </r>
        <c> Hodge Podge reroll that</c>
        <r> I got 11! The breakdown was (2[+3],3[+3]) </r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <p> This is actually just using a server variable called <code> last_roll </code>
      to remember the last thing you rolled. You can manually override it and look at it
      but do so at your own risk. malforming it will cause "reroll" to fail.
    </p>
    <h3> Custom Responses </h3>
    <p>
      When hodge podge rolls a critical miss or a critical hit for a single dice
      he will say "oof" or "nice!". But you can overide these for your server via
      <cmds>
        <c>Hodge Podge set critical_miss_msg to <hl>lmao u suck </hl></c>
        <c>Hodge Podge set critical_hit_msg to <hl>and that's pussy babe! </hl></c>
      </cmds>
      See below
      <cmds>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll a d20 </c>
        <r> oof. I got 1!</r>
        <c> Hodge Podge reroll </c>
        <r> I got 20! nice.</r>
        <c> Hodge Podge set critical_miss_msg to lmao u suck.</c>
        <r> Got it! </r>
        <c> Hodge Podge set critical_hit_msg to and that's pussy babe!</c>
        <r> Got it! </r>
        <c> Hodge Podge roll a d20 </c>
        <r> lmao u suck. I got 1!</r>
        <c> Hodge Podge reroll </c>
        <r> I got 20! and that's pussy babe!</r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h2> Utility Module </h2>
    <h3> Decisions </h3>
    <p>
      Hodge Podge can flip a coin or pick a random person in the chat.
      Note when picking a random person hodge podge will tag that person.
      This is useful for when you need to pick a random character to hex or hit in a battle.
    </p>
    <cmds>
      <c> Hodge Podge flip a coin </c>
      <r> It landed on heads!</r>
      <c> Hodge Podge pick someone </c>
      <r> I am gonna point at <hl>@Travis</hl>!</r>
    </cmds>
    <p>
      By default hodge podge treats all people in a channel equally no matter if they are online at the moment or not.
    </p>
    <h3> Conversions </h3>
    <p>
      To convert between feet and meters simply do
    </p>
    <cmds>
      <c> Hodge Podge whats 14 feet in meters </c>
      <r> It's 4.2672 meters!</r>
      <c> Hodge Podge whats 4.2672 meters in feet </c>
      <r> It's 14 feet!</r>
    </cmds>
    <p>

      <r> It's 14F!</r>
    </cmds>
    <h2> Scripting </h2>
    <p> Ok so i am a bit crazy and look for any excuse to build a compiler
      from scratch, So Hodge Podge comes with a very basic scripting engine which runs HodgeCode.
      If you arn't a programmer this may seem useless but keep reading, it has
      some usful features relevant to everyone! </p>

    <h3> Math </h3>
    <p> The scripting engine will evaluate any mathematical expression involving standard BODMAS </p>
    <cmds>
      <c> Hodge Podge do 5+4</c>
      <r> 9</r>
      <c> !hp do 2*2 - 2 + 1</c>
      <r> 3</r>
    </cmds>

    <h3> Dice </h3>
    <p>
      You can slip dice rolls into your mathematical equations,
      hodge podge will roll a dice and replace the result into your equation.
      <cmds>
        <c> !hp do d20+4-2*2</c>
        <r> 2 </r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Variables </h3>
    <p>
      Hodge Code can also access your server variables which lets you do some cool stuff
      like save variables relevant to play
      <cmds>
        <c> !hp set orc_bonus_damage to 8</c>
        <r> Got it! </r>
        <c> !hp do d6+orc_bonus_damage </c>
        <r> 10 </r>
      </cmds>
    </p>
    <h3> Collections / Looping </h3>
    <p>
      Coming soon! Maybe! Not sure if i wanna write a full tokeniser just yet.
